Let customers sign up to be notified when their favorite products are back in stock.

== Description ==

Back In Stock Notifications makes it possible for customers to sign up and get notified via e-mail when sold-out products become available.

The plugin adds a sign-up form right in the product page of every sold-out product and variation that customers can use to join the waitlist with their e-mail.

When a product is restocked, the plugin sends an e-mail to all customers who have joined its waitlist.
